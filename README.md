# StarterApp app

The purpose of this app is to act as a starting point for further development. It provides some
basic features including:

* Database integration and migrations
* Role-based security
* Local authentication
* Example navigation

This version of the app uses SQL Server for data storage and Entity Framework Core for object-relatinal mapping
and migrations.

To fully understand how it works, you should follow an appropriate set of tutorials such as 
[this one](https://edinburgh-napier.github.io/SET09102/tutorials/csharp/) which covers all of the main
concepts and techniques used here. However, if you want to jump straight in and work out any problems
as you go along, that will also work. The code uses structured comments for use with the 
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation generator tool. 

You can use any development environment with this project including

* [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The instructions assume you will be using VSCode since that is a lowest-common-denominator choice.
